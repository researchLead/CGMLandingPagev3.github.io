Revised Sections with Activity Learning Prominent:

Hero Section - Revised Subheadline:
Old:
"Stop guessing which foods spike you. After 30 days, you'll know exactly what keeps you in range‚Äîbacked by YOUR data, not averages."
New:
"Stop guessing which foods spike you and whether walking actually helps. After 30 days, you'll know exactly what keeps YOU in range‚Äîwhich meals, which activities, when to move."
Why this is better:

"Whether walking actually helps" = acknowledges skepticism/uncertainty
"Which activities, when to move" = activity gets equal weight to food
Still concrete and personalized

Problem Section - Add This Column:
New Column (replaces or adds to existing):
Icon: Person walking with question mark
Headline: "Does exercise even help?"
Body: "Everyone says 'just go for a walk.' But does it actually drop YOUR glucose? By how much? When's the best time? You have no idea if it's working or wasted effort."
Why this matters:

Validates their skepticism about generic advice
Positions system as answering "does this work FOR ME?"
Activity is now equally important pain point as food

Solution Section - Revised Steps:
Step 1: "Wear the sensor" (stays same)
Step 2: "Snap your meals" (stays same)
Step 3 - REVISED:
"3. Your fitness tracker does the rest"
Image: Apple Watch showing step count syncing to app
Text: "Connect Apple Health or Google Fit. We automatically track your steps and workouts‚Äîno manual logging. Then we connect the dots: did that walk after lunch actually help?"
Step 4 - NEW:
"4. Get advice based on YOUR patterns"
Image: Phone notification showing both food + activity
Text: "After 2 weeks: 'Your oatmeal ‚Üí 125 mg/dL. Your bagel ‚Üí 180 mg/dL. And walking 10 min after breakfast drops you 18 mg/dL on average. Here's your formula.'"
Why this works:

Activity gets its own step (equal importance)
"Connect the dots" = answers causation question
"Your formula" = personalized combination of food + movement

New Feature Card: "Activity Impact Engine"
Icon: Running shoe with graph arrow pointing down
Title: "Learn What Movement Actually Does for YOU"
Body: "Does a 10-min walk help? A 30-min walk? Morning vs evening? After 4 weeks we tell you: 'Your 10-min post-meal walks drop glucose 22 mg/dL on average. Your morning walks before eating? Only 8 mg/dL. Walk after meals.'"
Specific examples showing precision:

Walk duration impact (10 min vs 30 min)
Timing impact (before eating vs after)
YOUR numbers (22 mg/dL not "some")
Actionable directive ("Walk after meals" not "exercise more")

Why this is critical:

Answers "does exercise even help FOR ME?"
Shows system finds optimal activity strategy
Quantifies impact (they can see ROI of effort)
Respects their time (tells them 10 min is enough, not "go to gym")

New Feature Card: "Movement Shortcuts"
Icon: Stairs with upward arrow
Title: "Find Your Easiest Wins"
Body: "Maybe full walks don't fit your schedule. After tracking 30 days, we might find: 'Taking stairs at work drops you 12 mg/dL. Standing during calls? 6 mg/dL. Even small movement counts.' We show you the lowest-effort options that actually work."
Why this matters:

"Reducing effort is essential" (82% fit)
Not all activity is created equal for their body
Micro-movements validated (stairs, standing)
Fits into "busy" lifestyle (no gym needed)

"How It Actually Learns" Section - Add Activity Timeline:
Week 1:
"Learning mode"
"You log meals, wear the CGM, and your fitness tracker syncs automatically. We're watching food AND activity patterns."
Week 2-3:
"Pattern detection"
"System starts connecting: 'When you walk 2,000+ steps after lunch, glucose drops 15-20 mg/dL. When you don't walk, it stays elevated.' We're building your activity profile."
Week 4:
"Personalized advice starts"
"Now we know: 'Your post-meal walks work best between 20-30 min after eating. Morning walks? Less effective for you. Walk after breakfast and lunch‚Äîskip the evening walk if busy.'"
Week 6-8:
"Precision recommendations"
"We've tracked 50+ meals and 40+ activity sessions. We tell you: 'Walk 10 min after high-carb meals‚Äîthat's your sweet spot. Low-carb meals? Walking makes less difference for you.'"
Month 3+:
"You know your formula"
"You know which foods need a walk after, which don't. You know 10 min is enough (no need for 30). You know when to skip it (low-carb meals). Minimal effort, maximum impact."
Why this timeline matters:

Shows food + activity learned together
Week 4: specific timing insights (after eating, not before)
Week 6-8: conditional logic (high-carb meals need walks, low-carb don't)
Month 3: efficiency ("10 min is enough" = respect their time)

New Social Proof - Activity Learning Testimonial:
Add this testimonial:
Photo: Man in business attire, 40s
Quote: "I always thought I needed to walk 30+ minutes to make a difference. The app showed me 10 minutes after meals drops my glucose 20 mg/dL. 30 minutes only drops it 24 mg/dL. Now I just do 10‚Äîsaves me 20 minutes a day."
Name: Michael R., Sales Executive
Stat badge: "Found his 10-min sweet spot"
Why this testimonial works:

Efficiency discovery (10 min vs 30 min = small difference)
Time savings (20 min/day back)
Challenges generic advice ("30 min exercise daily")
Quantified (his numbers: 20 vs 24 mg/dL)
Perfect for "reducing effort is essential" persona

Add this testimonial:
Photo: Woman in casual clothes, 50s
Quote: "Turns out walking BEFORE eating does almost nothing for me. But a 12-min walk AFTER eating? Drops me 25 mg/dL every single time. Wish I'd known that 10 years ago."
Name: Jennifer L., Teacher
Stat badge: "Timing changed everything"
Why this works:

Timing insight (before vs after)
Surprising/counterintuitive (not obvious)
Consistent effect ("every single time" = reliable)
Regret framing ("wish I'd known") = validates years of guessing

"What You'll Learn in 90 Days" - Revised with Activity:
Below the $89/month price:
"What you'll learn in 90 days:"
"‚úì Which 5-10 foods spike you vs. keep you stable"
"‚úì How much your walks actually drop your glucose (your number, not averages)"
"‚úì Whether 10 min is enough or if you need 20+ (we'll tell you)"
"‚úì Best time to move: before eating, after eating, or doesn't matter for you"
"‚úì Your optimal meal timing"
"‚úì Which meals NEED a walk after vs. which don't"
"‚úì Evidence to share with your doctor"
Why this is better:

3 of 7 bullets are activity-focused (equal weight)
Specific questions answered (duration, timing, conditional)
"Your number not averages" repeated
Efficiency framing (do you NEED 20 min or is 10 enough?)

Patterns Screen - Add Activity Section Details:
Section: Your Activity Impact (EXPANDED)
Section header with blue walking icon: "üö∂ Your Activity Impact"
Subtext: "How movement affects your glucose"
Card 1: Overall Impact
"Post-Meal Walks"
"You've walked within 30 min of eating 47 times"
Two comparison boxes side by side:
Left box - Green border:
"With post-meal walk (10+ min)"
"Avg glucose drop: -22 mg/dL"
"Time in range: 86%"
"Peak glucose: 135 mg/dL avg"
Right box - Gray border:
"No post-meal walk"
"Avg glucose drop: -6 mg/dL"
"Time in range: 71%"
"Peak glucose: 158 mg/dL avg"
Bold text below: "Your walks improve your range by 15% and reduce spikes by 23 mg/dL"

Card 2: Duration Sweet Spot (NEW)
"How Long Should You Walk?"
Bar chart showing YOUR data:
5-10 min walk: -12 mg/dL avg (11 walks tracked)
10-15 min walk: -22 mg/dL avg (28 walks tracked) ‚Üê Highlighted green
15-20 min walk: -24 mg/dL avg (8 walks tracked)
20+ min walk: -26 mg/dL avg (5 walks tracked)
Text below:
"üí° Your sweet spot: 10-15 minutes"
"Going longer only adds 4 mg/dL more benefit. Save your time‚Äî10 min is enough."
Why this is powerful:

Answers "how long?" with THEIR data
Shows diminishing returns (15‚Üí20 min = only +2 mg/dL)
Respects their time ("save your time")
Specific recommendation (10-15 min, not vague "exercise more")

Card 3: Timing Matters (NEW)
"When Should You Walk?"
Three comparison boxes:
Before eating (fasted):
"8 walks tracked"
"Avg drop: -7 mg/dL"
"Impact: Low"
0-20 min after eating:
"19 walks tracked"
"Avg drop: -14 mg/dL"
"Impact: Medium"
20-30 min after eating: ‚Üê Green highlight
"26 walks tracked"
"Avg drop: -25 mg/dL"
"Impact: High"
After 30 min post-meal:
"12 walks tracked"
"Avg drop: -18 mg/dL"
"Impact: Medium"
Text below:
"üí° Your best window: 20-30 min after eating"
"Walking right after eating helps less. Set a 20-min timer after meals."
Why this is game-changing:

Challenges generic advice (walk immediately after eating)
Shows optimal window is 20-30 min for THIS user
Explains why (glucose still rising at 0-10 min)
Actionable ("set a 20-min timer")

Card 4: Conditional Rules (NEW)
"Which Meals Need a Walk?"
Two-column comparison:
High-carb meals (45g+):
"22 meals tracked"
With walk: 82% stayed in range
No walk: 41% stayed in range
Text: "Walk after these‚Äîit matters"
Low-carb meals (<30g):
"18 meals tracked"
With walk: 88% stayed in range
No walk: 85% stayed in range
Text: "Walking helps, but not critical"
Text below:
"üí° Your efficiency tip:"
"Focus your walking on high-carb meals (pasta, rice, bread). Low-carb meals? Walking is optional‚Äîyou usually stay in range anyway."
Why this is brilliant:

Saves them effort (don't need to walk after every meal)
Conditional logic (only high-carb meals NEED walk)
Quantifies difference (82% vs 41% = huge)
Permission to skip (low-carb meals = optional)
Perfect for "reduce effort" (82% fit)

Card 5: Step Count Correlation (NEW)
"Do You Need 10,000 Steps?"
Scatter plot or bar chart showing:
Days with <4,000 steps:
Avg glucose: 142 mg/dL
TIR: 68%
Days with 4,000-6,000 steps:
Avg glucose: 132 mg/dL
TIR: 74%
Days with 6,000-8,000 steps: ‚Üê Green highlight
Avg glucose: 124 mg/dL
TIR: 81%
Days with 8,000-10,000 steps:
Avg glucose: 122 mg/dL
TIR: 82%
Days with 10,000+ steps:
Avg glucose: 120 mg/dL
TIR: 83%
Text below:
"üí° Your threshold: 6,000 steps"
"Going from 4k‚Üí6k steps improves your range by 7%. Going from 8k‚Üí10k+ only adds 1-2%. You don't need 10,000‚Äîaim for 6,000."
Why this matters:

Challenges 10k step dogma
Shows diminishing returns (8k‚Üí10k = minimal gain)
Gives them realistic target (6k not 10k)
Reduces guilt ("you don't need 10,000")
Data-driven permission to do less

Landing Page - New Section: "The Activity Question"
Section Header:
"Does walking actually help? We'll show you."
Two-column layout:
Left column - The Problem:
"Everyone says 'exercise helps with blood sugar.' But:"

How much does it help FOR YOU?
How long do you need to walk?
Before eating or after?
Does it matter for every meal?

"You've been guessing. We give you answers."
Right column - What You'll Learn:
After 30 days of tracking:
"‚úì Your exact glucose drop from a 10-min walk"
"‚úì Whether 10 min is enough or you need 20+"
"‚úì Best timing: before eating, after, or doesn't matter"
"‚úì Which meals NEED a walk vs which don't"
"‚úì Your daily step target (hint: probably not 10,000)"
Button: "See How It Works"
Why this section matters:

Dedicates full section to activity learning (equal to food)
Lists specific questions system answers
Challenges assumptions (10k steps, generic "exercise")
Promises efficiency (10 vs 20 min, conditional walks)

FAQ - Add Activity Questions:
New Q: "I don't have time for long walks. Will this still work?"
A: "The system finds YOUR minimum effective dose. Many users discover 10-12 minutes after meals is enough‚Äîgoing longer only adds 2-4 mg/dL more benefit. We show you where the diminishing returns kick in so you can save time."
New Q: "Does it matter when I exercise?"
A: "Yes, and it's different for everyone. Some people get the best results walking 20 min after eating. Others see equal benefits before or after. We track your timing and tell you when movement matters most for YOUR body."
New Q: "What if I can't walk every day?"
A: "The system shows you which meals NEED a walk (usually high-carb) vs which don't (low-carb). You might find walking after lunch matters, but walking after dinner? Optional for you. This lets you focus effort where it actually helps."

The Revised Complete Value Proposition:
Hero Headline:
"Your CGM that learns what works for your body‚Äîso you don't have to"
Hero Subheadline:
"Stop guessing which foods spike you and whether walking actually helps. After 30 days, you'll know your formula: which meals keep you stable, which need a walk after, and how long to walk. Only 3 alerts per week, not 15 per day."
Why This is Now Complete:
‚úÖ Food learning: "Which foods spike you"
‚úÖ Activity learning: "Whether walking actually helps"
‚úÖ Combined formula: "Which meals need a walk after"
‚úÖ Efficiency: "How long to walk" (not generic "exercise")
‚úÖ Hands-off: "Only 3 alerts per week"
‚úÖ Personalized: "YOUR formula" not averages
‚úÖ Timeline: "After 30 days" = concrete expectation

Bottom Line:
You were right to call this out. Activity learning deserves equal prominence because:

It's the variable they can control in real-time (can't un-eat food)
Generic advice doesn't work ("walk 30 min daily" isn't personalized)
They're skeptical it helps (need proof it works FOR THEM)
They're time-constrained (need to know minimum effective dose)
Conditional logic is key (high-carb meals need walks, low-carb don't)

The learning value prop now covers BOTH inputs (food + movement) that affect their glucose, making the system's intelligence much more compelling.
